# Bring up a Model in PyTorch and Port it to the Device

**Please note!** The experiences in this repository should be considered to be in **preview/beta**.
Significant portions of these experiences are subject to change without warning. **No part of this code should be considered stable**.
Although this device is in public preview, if you are using these advanced experiences, we would like your feedback. If you have not
[registered for *private* preview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156349), please consider doing so before using this functionality
so that we can better track who is using it and how, and so that you can have a say in the changes we make to these experiences.

This tutorial will show you how to start from a concept, and how to bring it all the way through PyTorch, then OpenVINO, then
C++ OpenCV G-API, and finally onto the device.
